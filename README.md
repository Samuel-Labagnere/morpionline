# MORPIONLINE
## What is Morpionline ?
Morpionline is a tic tac toe game developped with React for an MMI associate degree project.\
You can play with your friends on the same device, or against the computer !\
(We'll try to create an online mode to play with your friends across the globe... But this may never be implemented in the game because of the imposed time)

## How can I play ?
First, you need to access the application: <a href="https://morpionline.netlify.app" target="_blank">Morpionline</a> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/material-sharp/24/000000/external-link.png" style="height: 15px" />\
Then, click `Start a new game` and choose your gamemode.\
You will just have to click on the case you wanna place your marker and try to finish before the timer ends up.\
**Good luck !**
